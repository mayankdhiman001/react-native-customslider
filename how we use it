To use the CustomSlider component successfully, ensure that you have the following setup in your React Native project:

Install the required packages:


npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
Link the packages:
For React Native version 0.59 or above, linking should be automatic. For older versions, you may need to manually link the packages by running:


react-native link react-native-reanimated
react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
Make sure your babel.config.js or .babelrc file includes the react-native-reanimated/plugin:
For babel.config.js:


module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
};
Now you can use the CustomSlider component in your project. Import and use it like this:


import CustomSlider from './path/to/CustomSlider';

// ...your other code

const MyComponent = () => {
  // ...your code

  return (
    <CustomSlider
      sliderWidth={...}
      min={...}
      max={...}
      step={...}
      onValueChange={...}
      multiSelect={...}
      style={...}
    />
};
With these steps completed, you should be able to use the CustomSlider component with the smooth animations and touch interactions powered by react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler libraries. Enjoy developing interactive range selection in your React Native application!
